EcoPuff - Full-Stack E-commerce ProjectA fully functional example project written in Node.js and Express, demonstrating how to build a complete REST API and frontend for an e-commerce platform.This project was built to showcase a full-stack application for EcoPuff, a concept dedicated to transforming e-cigarette waste into educational kits,the idea came from a Hackathon where participants where challenged to repurpose eletronic cigarretes and transform them into projects with a positive social and enviromental impact. It includes a backend API, a frontend client, and all the necessary components for a modern web application.In this project many features can be seen: Created a custom web server with Node.js and Express, using a modular router structure.Built a complete REST API to power an e-commerce platform, handling users, products, shopping carts, and orders.Implemented robust user authentication and authorization using JSON Web Tokens (JWT). Stored user passwords by hashing them with bcrypt.Connected to a MongoDB database and performed CRUD operations using Mongoose.Structured a backend application with clear separation of concerns (models, views, controllers, middleware).Implemented custom error handling and input sanitization middleware.Served a static frontend built with HTML, Tailwind CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript that consumes the backend API.How to Install and Run This E-commerce project: easiest way to get this project running is to follow the steps below. Prerequisites Node.js (v16 or higher recommended)npm (usually comes with Node.js)A MongoDB database instance (you can use a local instance or a free cloud-based one like MongoDB Atlas)InstallationClone this project:git clone https://github.com/your-username/ecopuff.git
cd ecopuff
Install backend dependencies:npm install
Set up your environment variables:Create a new file named .env in the root of the project directory. Copy the following content into it and replace the placeholder values with your actual data. The JWT_SECRET can be any long, random string.# The connection string for your MongoDB database
MONGO_URL=mongodb+srv://user:password@cluster.mongodb.net/ecopuff?retryWrites=true&w=majority

# A secret key for signing JSON Web Tokens
JWT_SECRET=yourSuperSecretAndLongKeyHere

# The port the server will run on
PORT=3000
Start the server:This command uses nodemon to automatically restart the server when files are changed.npm start
The backend API will now be running on the port you specified (e.g., http://localhost:3000). The frontend can be accessed by opening the index.html file located in the public folder.H ow to Tweak This Project For Your Own Uses Since this is an example project, you are encouraged to clone and rename it for your own purposes. It serves as an excellent boilerplate for building full-stack Node.js applications.Known Issues (Work in Progress)This project is a functional proof-of-concept and does not include a real payment processing integration.The "Forgot Password" functionality is not implemented and the order history feature is still in progress.
